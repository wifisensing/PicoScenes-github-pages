## Verify the installation

In MATLAB `Current Folder` or Ubuntu file explorer, navigate to `PicoScenes-MATLAB-Toolbox-Core/samples` directory, *drag'n'drop* the two sample .csi files into the Command Window, then they will be parsed into cell arrays named `samples_9300` and `samples_x310`, respectively.

## Usage

You have three ways to parse a .csi file with PMT-Core:

1. Double-click the selected .csi file in MATLAB Current Folder.
2. Drag'n'Drop one or multiple .csi files into MATLAB Command Window.
3. Run `opencsi(FILE_PATH)` in MATLAB Command Window, where `FILE_PATH` is the path to the selected .csi file.

After parsing, you will see bundles with the same names as the .csi files in MATLAB Workspace.

## Structures of the PicoScenes Tx and Rx frames

![PicoScenes Tx/Rx Frame Structure](/images/PicoScenesFrameStructure.jpg)

Figure shows the Tx and Rx frame structures adopted by PicoScenes. PicoScenes frames consist of multiple `PicoScenes Segments` (segment). Each segment is a named and more importantly versioned container which holds heterogeneous data structure or content.

The PMT-Core parses the .csi files in two steps, the Raw Parsing and Bundled Parsing. 
- The Raw Parsing: PMT-Core first parses each Rx frame into a MATLAB `cell`. If a .csi file contains \(N\) Rx frames, the Raw Parsing stage will produce a cell array with \(N\) elements.
- The Bundled Parsing: This step tries to merge the cells generated by Raw Parsing into a unified structure, which is much easier for analysis. However, **the merging may fail** if the internal data structures are different across all measurements. And if it fails, a warning message will be shown.

## Data structures of the Raw Parsing

Each cell of the result array generated by Raw Parsing contains the following items. You may click the links on the left to view its internal structure.
